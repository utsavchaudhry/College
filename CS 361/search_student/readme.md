# Find the Target with threads

See Blackboard Learn for detailed instructions.

You are given the following source files.

- `experiments.cpp` and `experiments.h` contain some tests for your code
- `find_target.cpp` and `find_target.h` are where you will do the assignment.
- `main.cpp` is mainly for parsing command line inputs.

You may not change `experiments.cpp`, `experiments.h`, or `main.cpp`.

You may only change `find_target.cpp` and `find_target.h`.

To run everything just do `make all`. 

You can also check the makefile for individual commands.
