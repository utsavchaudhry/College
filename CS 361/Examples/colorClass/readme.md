#Color Thread Example

Mark Boady

This code uses threads to make an image with random colors. The number of threads will be decided by the hardware.

This shows how a class can be used to organize shared data.

```
type 
make
```

to compile and run to tests

or
```
make bin/bmp
./bin/bmp width height filename.bmp
```

to generate an image
