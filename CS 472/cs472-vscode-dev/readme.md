## A VSCode DevContainer

Given we will be doing C development in this course, it has always been a challenge getting 100% compatibility between Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  

We will be using Linux as our master, given most back end server software is deployed to Linux.

While you are free to do your homework using MacOS, Windows, or Linux, the historical most problematic envioronment to do C based network programming has been on Windows.  While you can work through these things, the best alternatives are to use:

- Tux (Linux)
- This Expirmental VSCode-based dev container.  Note you will need to have docker installed on your machine to run this.  Please use Docker Desktop - its free and you can get it here: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- The Linux subsystem for Windows is another good choice. 

As for MacOS.  The Mac is Unix based, you should not have any issues if you stick with with the Mac.  That said, MacOS roots are more alignd with BSD Unix, and sometimes is not 100% compatible with Linux, however, for what we will be doing in this class you should be OK using the Mac directly.
